#### About Me

I am a PhD student in the School of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Surrey. I am currently doing research into the movements of badgers. My main research interests include:
- Understanding the movement of badgers through a variety of mathematical tools.
- Have a brief understanding into how this can affect the transmission of bTB. 

Further details about some of my current work are available to read [here](/assets/FURBER_Confirmation_Report.pdf).
